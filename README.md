Suicide rate project.
Data analysis on suicide rate in 101 countries from 1985 to 2016.

Hi there, welcome to my first data analysis project.
I've been working on this with the goal to get confident with some of the most common tools used in data analysis to manipulate 
and visualize data.
At the same time, I wanted to offer an easy-to-read presentation of the data set, highlighting different approches for further
research.
Any social, political and economical discussion based on this data is out of the scope of this notebook, leaving the reader 
free to extend those analysis. 
Any suggestion to correct and improve the results showed or the code used, is more than welcome.

Thanks a lot for your time.

HOW TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK:
If you don't want to clone the repository:
1 - Open the jupiter notebook file here in the repository
2 - At the very top of the notebook, on the right, click on the button "Raw" (next to "Blame", "History")
3 - Save the file with Ctrl + S
4 - in the saving window now opened, navigate to the directory where you want the file to be saved
BEFORE SAVING THE FILE: make sure the file format is .ipynb (not .txt) and in the "Save as Type" option, "All files" is selected rather than "Text files"
